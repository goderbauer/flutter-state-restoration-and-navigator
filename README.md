# Flutter - State Restoration and Navigator 2.0 Example

A new Flutter project.
This repository is an attempt at demonstrating an app that uses Navigator 2.0 for its routing and state restoration to restore those routes.

It is based off of [John Ryan's Navigator 2.0 article](https://medium.com/flutter/learning-flutters-new-navigation-and-routing-system-7c9068155ade).
